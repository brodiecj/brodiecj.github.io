    IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
    -scalability based on screen size!!!
    -better looking alert, not a box, but an on screen alert in keeping with game

    PROBLEMS THAT AROSE DURING INITIAL STYLING:
    -my orginal idea was to use an SVG image of an old school TV created by my wife and use it 
    as a background image and center the game inside the screen, but I couldn't get the image 
    to scale and encountered the following problems:
    -using a background image and having it take up the entire screen and be scalable
    -background-color for h1 contained to the size of canvas; background-color was stretching
    across the entire screen and therefore going outside the SVG image of the screen
